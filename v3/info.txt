e_ns = true if a card in hand has value n and suit s
p_ns = true if piled card is value n and suit s
w = true if the sum of n's for all e_ns <= 7.
m_nq = e_ns has q cards with same value n in hand
sm_nq = p_ns has q cards with same value n that are in hand
f_sc = e_ns has c consecutive cards with same s in hand
sf_sc = p_ns has c consecutive cards with same s in hand
g_ad = true if a group in hand has length a and sum of n equal to d. e.g 2 hearts, 3 hearts, 4 hearts is a group with length 3 and sum of n equal to 9.
a_g = true if g_ad is the highest group in terms of a in the hand.
d_g = true if g_ad (or just g denoting this specific group) is the highest group in terms of d in the hand.
sg_ad = true if a group in hand+pile has length a and sum of n equal to d. 
sa_g = true if sg_ad (g denoting this specific group) is the highest group in terms of length a in hand+pile.
sd_g = true if sg_ad is the highest group in terms of sum d in hand+pile.
c = true when an a_g and a sa_g have at least one e_ns in common.
nc = true when a g_ad and a sa_g have no e_ns in common.
va = true when sa_g has higher length a than a_g.
vd = true when sd_g has higher sum d than d_g.
rx = best g_ad in hand is put down on top of pile.
ry = second best g_ad in hand is put down on top of pile.
us = true if pile card is picked up
ud = true if random card from deck is picked up
l = pile card less than 7
